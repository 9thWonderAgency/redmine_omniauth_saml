h1. Redmine OmniAuth CAS plugin

This plugins adds CAS authentication support for "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org thanks to the "OmniAuth authentication framework":https://github.com/intridea/omniauth. OmniAuth is a Rack middleware that let you authenticate against many sources (see "the list of supported sources":https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/blob/master/README.md). This plugin aims at being an example of integration for the CAS protocol, but it shouldn't be that difficult to build a plugin that allows authentication against other sources.

*NB*: the plugin doesn't support on-the-fly registration for now.
